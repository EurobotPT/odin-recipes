                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Remove the skin from the sausage and cut into thin slices or half-moons. Chop the onion and garlic. Peel and cut the potatoes into cubes. Cut the collard greens into very thin (chiffonade cut)</li>
                        
                        <li>In a pan, add oil and fry the sausage until golden brown. Remove and reserve it a bow</li>
                        
                        <li>In the same pan you used for the sausage, add a little more oil and sauté the onion and garlic.</li>

                        <li>Add the potatoes, salt and water or homemade broth, keep the pan over high heat until the liquid starts to boil. Then, reduce the heat to medium and cook the potatoes until tender (approx. 20 min).</li>

                        <li>Turn off the heat and with the help of a hand mixer or blender, beat the soup to turn it into a cream.</li>

                        <li>If using a blender, return the cream to the pan.</li>

                        <li>Add the fried sausage, then the kale and cook it for more 5 minutes. Taste and correct the salt, if necessary.</li>

                        <li>Now it's time to serve! Don't forget to drizzle olive oil in each bowl.</li>
                    </ol>
